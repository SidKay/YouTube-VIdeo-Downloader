# YouTube-Video-Downloader
A Simple App that can download YouTube Videos

## P.S.: If you're trying to download a video with the program, just wait for it. It may look like the program is not responding but it really is.

You can download and run it [here](https://github.com/SidKay/YT-Vid-Downloader-Program)

### Build 3 (28/09/2022)

- You can now select where you want to download your video to.

### Build 5 (12/10/2022)

### Build 8? (12/08/2023)
